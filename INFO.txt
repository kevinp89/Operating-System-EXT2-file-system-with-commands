We reached quite a number of problems referencing the correct inode, as is
the case for ext2_restore where we use a different method to get the target
inode, (found_node).

We did encounter some problems at the end regarding ln, where hardlink count wasn't going up, after the last
commmit, it still didn't go up even though the code was implemmented. But the linking did work.
